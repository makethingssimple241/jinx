## Introduction

### Features supported

#### x86-64 architecture

1. Text-based graphics driver in graphics video mode
1. Driver for COM1 and COM2 serial ports
1. Driver for 2 cascaded 8259 PICs

## Building and running

### Requirements

1. `python3`
1. `git`
1. `make`
1. `cc` (used to build Limine)
1. `curl`
1. `clang` (you can modify `build.py` to use other compilers)
1. `x86_64-elf-binutils`
1. `xorriso` (you can modify `build.py` to use generate the cdrom differently)
1. `qemu-system-x86_64`

> **Note**

> - `python3`,
> - `git`,
> - `make`,
> - `cc`,
> - `curl`,
> - `clang`,
> - `x86_64-elf-ld` (from `x86_64-elf-binutils`),
> - `xorriso`,  and

> 
> will be invoked as listed above.
> 
> You must either modify the related Python scripts and `Makefile`s to invoke the tools the way your environment expects them to be invoked, or modify your environment such that the above listed tools can be invoked as is.

### Guide

1. Run `configure.py` which will download all the necessary third-party files
1. Run `build.py` which will build and produce a cdrom
1. Pass `run` to `build.py` if you would like the cdrom to be ran with `qemu-system-x86_64`

> **Note**
> 
> Run `unconfigure.py` to remove all the build files and third-party files downloaded by `configure.py`

### Debugging

When debugging:

1. Pass `debug` to `build.py`. Doing so will pass `-s -S` to `qemu-system-x86_64` which will allow you to attach a remote debugger to debug the operating system.
1. Start a debugger that can be used with QEMU and set the remote target to `localhost:1234`
1. Set the architecture and file (kernel file) according to the way you do so in your debugger

Happy debugging ðŸŽ‰
